= Models
Models are subclasses of <tt>ActiveRecord::Base</tt>.
To add a new data model to your kit run

  $ rake mk:model[new_model_name]

in the kit's root directory (+new_model_name+ should be a singular noun).
This will create a new model file named +new_model_name.rb+.

All kits start with the basic models +Bit+, +Group+, +User+, and +Permission+, but you can still create those model files here to add custom functionality to the basic models.
