= Models
Models are subclasses of +ActiveRecord::Base+.
To add a new data model to your kit run

  $ rake mk:model[new_model_name]

in the kit's root directory (new_model_name should be a singular noun).
This will create a new model file named +new_model_name.rb+.

All kits start with the models +Bit+, +Group+, +User+, and +Permission+, but you can still create your these model files here to add custom functionality to these basic models.
