= Actions
Actions are modules that add instance methods to +Bit+ objects.
Bits can be grouped together. To create a new group, run
  $ rake mk_group[new_group_name]
in the kit's root directory.
This will create a new group in the database and an action file named +new_group_name.rb+.

Any instance methods added to the KitActionsNewGroupName module can be called on a +Bit+ object which belongs to that group.
The KitActionsDefault module is loaded for bits without a group.
